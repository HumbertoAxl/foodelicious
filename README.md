# About

Foodelicious is a recipe web app I'm currently working on for two reasons: I want to showcase my React and Material UI skills, and I also want to find new recipes to try out in the kitchen. It's still a work in progress, and since I need to manually add some data to complement the Spoonacular API, it's taking a bit longer than expected. However, I'm determined to finish it within the next couple of weeks and share it with everyone! :)
